**Reporting a Vulnerability**

Any vulnerability present in the codes must be submitted to our Dev Team through any means. Those who do so will be credited with a custom Discord Role, and their username will be listed on the [README.md](skyelementsbot/README.md) file. If theres a significant flaw in the codes but was misused against the EULA and License, we may take any type of action against the offender with or without their consent. Misuse of our code may led to serious consequence as our code is protected through License(s) which enable others to fair use the code without reverse-engineering it.
