###### Reporting a Vulnerability
Developers who find a vulnerability in the source code can report it by creating a new issue or submitting a pull request to the GitHub repository. Certain vulnerabilities will be discovered automatically by GitHub and/or third-party automated workflows (also known as "Actions") whenever there is a new commit.

###### Open Source, Fair Use and Legal Terms
Any vulnerability present in the source code must be reported directly to the maintainers of this repository. If there's any flaw in the source code that was misused by the developer and it is against the license agreement, we may take action against them. Illegal use of the source code may result in serious consequences because they are protected by open-source licenses that allow users to use the source code fairly without manipulating or reverse-engineering them for any illegal activity.
