Welcome to the official repository for our discord bot. This is currently still a small-scale project by JavaRuntime#2847. Our bot is currently running locally on a command terminal for test and debugging purposes. We will ensure that the bot will run 24/7 through Cloud Computing services like Microsoft Azure or Heroku in the near future.
